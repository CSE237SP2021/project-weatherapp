# cse237-project

What user stories were completed this iteration?
  We completed creating a user account, as well as adding a favorite location by city name or by zip code. We also worked on the WeatherData class to call our OpenWeather API, and made calls from Menu to Location, which then called the WeatherData API class. We added the functionality to request weather by city name. 

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  We plan to successfully call the OpenWeather API, as now our get request is having problems going through. If we have time, we could also request not only current weather data, but hourly forcast data. 
  
  
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  The GET requests in the WeatherData class fail. 

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

To run the code, please run bash run.sh
