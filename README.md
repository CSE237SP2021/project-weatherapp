# cse237-project

What user stories were completed this iteration?
  We completed signing in/out functionality for users as well as added the functionality for users to get the weather of their favorite location by city name or by zip code quickly as an option in the menu. We completed parsing the string buffer of the JSON to get the weather description, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature.
  
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
No. 

Note:
We are correctly reading and parsing the JSON from the API, but the API we are using (OpenWeatherMap API) is returning temperature values that seem off. Meaning, that for most places it returns temperatures around 50 degrees fahrenheit. 

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
To run the code, please run 'bash run.sh'
