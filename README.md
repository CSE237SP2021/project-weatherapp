# cse237-project

What user stories were completed this iteration?
  We completed asking the user to specify if they wanted to get weather data by entering a zip code or a city name, and creating the Location class to store attributes of a Location. We also created a WeatherData class to call our OpenWeather API, but we are currently having problems getting it to work. 

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  We plan to successfully call the OpenWeather API using zip code, call the API using city name, and display data to the user. In later iterations we would like to implement a login screen so that users can log in and see their favorite weather locations immediately. 
  
  
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  The WeatherData class which requests information from the OpenWeather API. 

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
To run the code, you can type in the following commands: 
cd src
cd code
javac Menu.java
java Menu



********We also had to merge to master after creating the base project so that our team members could open it in eclipse-otherwise, we will not merge to master until a release***************
